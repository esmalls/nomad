Project N.O.M.AD

N.O.M.A.D stands for NXT Optimal Movement and Autonomous Drive. This project is based on a simple algorithm I created for a robotics competition in High School. The objective of this competition was to create a fully autonomous robot capable of simple decision making as it used obstacle avoidance to navigate a maze.
